This paper will focus on implementation of machine learning models to predict stability of the grid, utilizing the data set Arzamasov created (2018). This data set is a simulation of a four-node star electrical grid with centralized production. The data set includes 14 total attributes - 11 predictive attributes, one non-predictive (p1), and two goal fields.
